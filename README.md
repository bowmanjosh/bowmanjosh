- 👋 Hi, I’m Josh Bowman.
- 👀 I’m interested in using GitHub as a portfolio for my personal projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to get my first job in tech. I have a BA in computer science; after college I worked in another field for a few years.
- 📫 If you came here because I applied for a job with you, my contact information can be found in my resume.
